JAVA SPRING MICROSERVICES with KAFKA

This stack example is a backend loosely based on the book "Microservices with Spring Boot and Spring Cloud"
from Magnus Larsson. It consists of 6 projects, starting from microservices with synchronous communication upto
microservices with a mixture of none-blocking synchronuous and event based streaming communication.

Each of the projects offers its own README file and comments in the source code.
